# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

A simple process forking method was used to implement parallel downloading
and uploading. The main routine forks one child process per staged download,
such that all initial downloads proceed in parallel. Next, the main routine
listens for upload requests, then forks for each upload request. Multiple
upload requests will proceed in parallel. Once a single upload or download
request is completed, the child process will exit.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

1. One potential buffer overflow point of entry is in the start_download
function, which isn't a point of entry for a malicious peer but rather for the
initializer of the peer - he/she could give a filename which is longer than
FILENAMESIZ - 1, which is would cause overflows when printing or copying it.
We decided the best course of action would be to print an error regarding the
improper size of the current filename, and then continue to the next download
(instead of aborting the entire program).

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
